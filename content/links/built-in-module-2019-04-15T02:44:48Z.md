title: "Built-in Module"
description: "Built-in modules are just like regular JavaScript modules, except that they don’t have to be downloaded because they ship with the browser.
Like traditional web APIs, built-in modules must go through a standardization process — each will have its own specification that requires a design review and positive signs of support from both web developers and other browser vendors before it can ship. (In Chrome, built-in modules will follow the same launch process we use to implement and ship all new APIs."
